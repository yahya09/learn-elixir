# Chapter 7: Advanced Routing

Phoenix's router is powerful and flexible. In this chapter, we'll explore advanced routing patterns including nested resources, scopes, custom routes, and API versioning.

## What You'll Learn

- Nested resources and route nesting
- Scopes and namespaces
- Custom route helpers
- Route constraints and conditions
- API versioning strategies
- Route organization patterns

## Chapter Structure

This chapter covers:

- **7.1 Nested Resources** - Parent-child resource relationships
- **7.2 Scopes and Namespaces** - Organizing routes logically
- **7.3 Custom Routes** - Beyond REST conventions

## The Router as the Application Map

The router defines your application's public interface:

```elixir
# Every URL your app responds to is defined here
scope "/", SnippetboxWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  get "/", PageController, :home
  resources "/snippets", SnippetController
end
```

Understanding advanced routing helps you:

1. **Design intuitive URLs**
2. **Organize code logically**
3. **Build maintainable APIs**
4. **Handle complex relationships**

Let's start with nested resources.
