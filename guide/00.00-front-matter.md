# Let's Build with Elixir and Phoenix

**Learn to build professional web applications with Elixir and Phoenix Framework**

---

## About This Book

This book will teach you how to build professional, production-ready web applications using Elixir and Phoenix Framework. Whether you're coming from Python, PHP, C#, JavaScript, or another language, this guide will help you master functional programming and the Phoenix ecosystem.

## What You'll Build

Throughout this book, we'll build **SnippetBox** - a real-world web application for creating and sharing text snippets (similar to Pastebin or GitHub Gists). By the end, you'll have:

- A fully functional web application with user authentication
- Knowledge of Elixir's functional programming paradigm
- Understanding of Phoenix's MVC-style architecture
- Experience with Ecto for database operations
- Skills in testing, deployment, and production best practices

## Target Audience

This book is written for **senior software engineers** who:

- Have professional experience with web development
- Are familiar with languages like Python, PHP, C#, or JavaScript
- Have minimal or no experience with functional programming
- Want practical, hands-on learning rather than pure theory

## What Makes This Different

Unlike pure language tutorials, this book:

- **Builds a complete application** from scratch
- **Explains functional programming concepts** in practical context
- **Provides comparisons** to patterns you know from OOP languages
- **Includes references** for deeper learning on each topic
- **Follows Phoenix conventions** and best practices

## How to Use This Book

1. **Read sequentially** - Each chapter builds on previous ones
2. **Code along** - Type out the examples yourself
3. **Experiment** - Try variations and modifications
4. **Use the references** - Dive deeper into topics that interest you
5. **Complete the exercises** - Reinforce your learning

## Source Code

Complete source code for the SnippetBox application is available in the `source-code/` directory. However, we recommend coding along with the tutorial for better learning outcomes.

## Conventions Used

- **Code blocks** include file paths to show where code belongs
- **Terminal commands** are prefixed with `$`
- **Important notes** highlight critical concepts
- **FP Concept boxes** explain functional programming ideas
- **Additional Information** sections provide deeper technical details

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have installed:

- Elixir 1.16 or later
- Erlang/OTP 26 or later
- PostgreSQL 14 or later
- A code editor with Elixir support

Installation instructions are provided in Chapter 1.

## Acknowledgments

- The Phoenix Framework team
- José Valim and the Elixir core team
- The extensive Phoenix documentation
- Community tutorials and resources
